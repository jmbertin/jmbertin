<h1 align="center"><b>Hi there, welcome to my official public repo üëã</b></h1>
 

For 20 years, I wore the badge of a police officer üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, dedicating myself to ensuring safety and upholding the law. My passion for security was not just limited to the physical realm; it extended to the digital world as well.

**In November 2022**, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling at **42 School**. This institution opened the doors to the vast and intricate world of coding for me. Since my first day at 42 üéì, I've immersed myself in a multitude of projects, each one broadening my horizons. These projects, spanning various programming languages, have allowed me to delve into diverse themes, with a particular interest in security and cybersecurity.

42 School has been more than just an educational institution for me. It's a place where I've met some of the most genuine, brilliant minds. Collaborating with these individuals, coupled with the guidance from the exceptional pedagogical team, has pushed me to surpass my limits day after day.

Whether it's assignments from 42 or my personal ventures, each project represents a milestone in my coding journey. I invite you to explore my repositories to witness the array of challenges I've embraced and the innovative solutions I've devised. My passion for security, both in the real and digital worlds, continues to drive my endeavors in the realm of coding and cybersecurity.
