<h1 align="center"><b>Hi there, welcome to my official public repo üëã</b></h1>
 

For 20 years, I wore the badge of a police officer üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, dedicating myself to ensuring safety and upholding the law. My passion for security was not just limited to the physical realm; it extended to the digital world as well.

**In November 2022**, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling at **42 School**. This institution opened the doors to the vast and intricate world of coding for me. Since my first day at 42 üéì, I've immersed myself in a multitude of projects, each one broadening my horizons. These projects, spanning various programming languages, have allowed me to delve into diverse themes, with a particular interest in security and cybersecurity.

42 School has been more than just an educational institution for me. It's a place where I've met some of the most genuine, brilliant minds. Collaborating with these individuals, coupled with the guidance from the exceptional pedagogical team, has pushed me to surpass my limits day after day.

Whether it's assignments from 42 or my personal ventures, each project represents a milestone in my coding journey. I invite you to explore my repositories to witness the array of challenges I've embraced and the innovative solutions I've devised. My passion for security, both in the real and digital worlds, continues to drive my endeavors in the realm of coding and cybersecurity.

[Libft](https://github.com/jmbertin/Libft) - 42 school curriculum. Very first project in 42. It's a C library that recreates certain standard functions from the libc, as well as a few additional and bonus functions that prove to be extremely useful for subsequent projects.

[Ft_printf](https://github.com/jmbertin/FT_Printf) - 42 school curriculum. It's an attempt to recreate the famous printf function found in the C standard library, a function known for its versatility in handling string formatting. This version is a simplified take on it.

[Ft_nm](https://github.com/jmbertin/Ft_Nm) - 42 school curriculum. It's a custom implementation of the UNIX nm command, designed to display the symbol table of ELF binaries. This project was developed as part of a UNIX programming assignment and replicates the core functionality of the GNU nm command (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) v2.40.

[Minitalk](https://github.com/jmbertin/Minitalk) - 42 school curriculum. It's a unique communication system built on UNIX signals. This lightweight server-client application allows for a simple and direct means of interprocess communication through customized handling of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.

[Malloc](https://github.com/jmbertin/Malloc) - 42 school curriculum. In this project, we have implemented our own versions of the `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc` functions to dynamically manage memory in C programs.

[Lem-IPC](https://github.com/jmbertin/Lem-IPC) - 42 school curriculum. Lem-IPC is an automated game where bots, grouped into teams, strategically position themselves on a 2D board. The primary objective is for a team to outlast the others and claim the board. Bots are eliminated when surrounded by members of another team. The game's climax is reached when only one team remains on the battlefield.

[Ft_ping](https://github.com/jmbertin/Ft_ping) - 42 school curriculum. This repository contains a custom implementation of the ping utility, written in C. The program sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts and displays the response to measure the round-trip time and packet loss.

[Ft_ssl_md5](https://github.com/jmbertin/Ft_ssl_md5) - 42 school curriculum. This program provides an implementation of popular cryptographic hashing algorithms, including MD5, SHA256 and Whirlpool. It allows users to generate hash digests of strings, files, or standard input.
