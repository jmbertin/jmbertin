### Hi there, welcome to my official public repo üëã

## Who am I ?
I've been serving as a police officer üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for 20 years, ensuring safety and upholding the law. **In November 2022, I embarked on a new journey by joining 42 School**.

At 42 üéì, I've had the privilege of diving deep into the world of coding. From the day I stepped into this institution, **I've worked on dozens of projects**. These projects span various programming languages and cover an array of themes.

It is also here that I was able to meet the most human, the most brilliant people, with whom I was able to work and exchange. It is largely thanks to its students, but also thanks to its formidable pedagogical team that I was able, day after day, to surpass myself.

Whether it's assignments from 42 or my personal ventures, each project has been a step forward in my coding journey. Explore my repositories to see the diverse range of problems I've tackled and solutions I've crafted.

## Summary
üöÄ Dive into my repositories below to explore a diverse array of projects **I've passionately crafted**, ranging from 42 School assignments to personal endeavors that showcase my evolving journey in the world of coding.

### C projects

[Libft](https://github.com/jmbertin/Libft) - 42 school curriculum. Very first project in 42. It's a C library that recreates certain standard functions from the libc, as well as a few additional and bonus functions that prove to be extremely useful for subsequent projects.

[Ft_printf](https://github.com/jmbertin/FT_Printf) - 42 school curriculum. It's an attempt to recreate the famous printf function found in the C standard library, a function known for its versatility in handling string formatting. This version is a simplified take on it.

### Security projects

[Rainfall](https://github.com/jmbertin/Rainfall) - 42 school curriculum. This project is part of the intermediate security course. Rainfall is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where you will find vulnerabilities in code and exploit them to progress to the next level.

### Others projects
[React Native - Snake Game](https://github.com/jmbertin/ReactNative-Snake) - This is my first React Native project. A classical Snake game, developed using React Native! This game is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.
