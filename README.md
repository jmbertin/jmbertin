# Hi there, welcome to my official public repo üëã

## Who am I ?
I've been serving as a police officer üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for 20 years, ensuring safety and upholding the law. 

**In November 2022, I embarked on a new journey by joining 42 School**.

At 42 üéì, I've had the privilege of diving deep into the world of coding. From the day I stepped into this institution, **I've worked on dozens of projects**. These projects span various programming languages and cover an array of themes.

It is also here that I was able to meet the most human, the most brilliant people, with whom I was able to work and exchange. It is largely thanks to its students, but also thanks to its formidable pedagogical team that I was able, day after day, to surpass myself.

Whether it's assignments from 42 or my personal ventures, each project has been a step forward in my coding journey. Explore my repositories to see the diverse range of problems I've tackled and solutions I've crafted.

## Summary

üöÄ Dive into my repositories below to explore a diverse array of projects **I've passionately crafted**, ranging from 42 School assignments to personal endeavors that showcase my evolving journey in the world of coding.

----

### C projects

[Libft](https://github.com/jmbertin/Libft) - 42 school curriculum. Very first project in 42. It's a C library that recreates certain standard functions from the libc, as well as a few additional and bonus functions that prove to be extremely useful for subsequent projects.

[Ft_printf](https://github.com/jmbertin/FT_Printf) - 42 school curriculum. It's an attempt to recreate the famous printf function found in the C standard library, a function known for its versatility in handling string formatting. This version is a simplified take on it.

[Ft_nm](https://github.com/jmbertin/Ft_Nm) - 42 school curriculum. It's a custom implementation of the UNIX nm command, designed to display the symbol table of ELF binaries. This project was developed as part of a UNIX programming assignment and replicates the core functionality of the GNU nm command (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) v2.40.

### Security projects

[Rainfall](https://github.com/jmbertin/Rainfall) - 42 school curriculum. This project is part of the intermediate security course. Rainfall is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where you will find vulnerabilities in code and exploit them to progress to the next level.

[Dr_Quine](https://github.com/jmbertin/Dr_Quine) - 42 school curriculum. This project invites you to confront the principle of self-reproduction and the problems that derive from it. It is a perfect introduction to more complex projects, particularly malware projects.

[Override](https://github.com/jmbertin/Override) - 42 school curriculum. This project is the last security course. Override is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where you will find vulnerabilities in code and exploit them to progress to the next level.

### C++ projects

[Ft_IRC](https://github.com/jmbertin/Ft_IRC) - 42 school curriculum. It's about creating our own IRC server according to standard RFC 2813 in C++ language.

----

### SysAdmin projects

[Docker - Inception](https://github.com/jmbertin/Inception) - 42 school curriculum. This project allows you to discover and become familiar with Docker and its tools, building a functionnal local Wordpress website.

----

### Graphic projects

[React Native - Snake Game](https://github.com/jmbertin/ReactNative-Snake) - This is my first React Native project. A classical Snake game, developed using React Native! This game is compatible with both iOS and Android platforms.
